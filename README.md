### Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a **customized version of the Linux kernel**, maintained by the **Armbian team**, with specific adaptations for **Rockchip SoCs** (System-on-Chips) used in a wide range of ARM-based single board computers.

It serves as the base for:

- **Kernel development and maintenance** for Armbian-supported devices.
- **Hardware enablement**, performance tuning, and stability patches specific to Rockchip-based platforms.
- **Integration with the Armbian build framework** to produce ready-to-use OS images.

This repository is intended for developers, testers, and contributors working with the Armbian project and the broader Rockchip ARM ecosystem.
